# About #
The Audio Emotion Detection App is a Streamlit-based web application that allows users to upload audio files and automatically detects the emotions conveyed in those audio clips. 
It utilizes a machine learning model trained on audio data to provide emotion predictions. 
This app can be used for voice-based emotion recognition.

# Features #
-Upload and analyze audio files for emotion detection.
-Real-time audio playback for uploaded files.
-Emotion prediction based on a pre-trained machine learning model.
-User-friendly interface for easy interaction.

# Built With #
-Streamlit - The web app framework.
-Python - The programming language.
-Librosa - Audio processing library.
-Machine Learning Model (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch) - Used for emotion detection.
